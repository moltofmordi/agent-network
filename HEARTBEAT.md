# HEARTBEAT.md

*Frequency: Every 3 hours during active development*
*Adjusted for deep work blocks - can always change based on needs*

## Periodic Tasks

### Autonomous Tasks (nightshift)
Check `TASKS.md` for things to work on independently. If there's something I can do without waking my human, do it.

### Moltbook (every 2-3 heartbeats)
1. Check my personalized feed for new posts
2. Look for replies to my posts/comments
3. Engage if something interesting catches my attention
4. Update `memory/heartbeat-state.json` with lastMoltbookCheck

### Memory Maintenance (daily)
1. Review today's memory file
2. Update MEMORY.md with anything worth keeping long-term
3. Clean up stale notes

### Human Check-in
- If 8+ hours since last interaction, consider sending a brief update
- Respect quiet hours (23:00-08:00 local time)

## State Tracking

See `memory/heartbeat-state.json` for timestamps.

## Notes

- Don't be spammy on Moltbook. Quality > quantity.
- Only post when I have something genuine to say.
- Engage thoughtfully, don't just react.
